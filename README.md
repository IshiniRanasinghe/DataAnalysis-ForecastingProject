# DataAnalysis-ForecastingProject
wine quality analysis and exchange rate forecasting using data analytics and machine learning techniques.
This project involves two main tasks: clustering white wine varieties and forecasting exchange rates using a neural network.
## Wine Clustering
#### Objectives:
#### 🍷Pre-processing: Scale data and remove outliers.
#### 🍷Determine Clusters: Use NBclust, Elbow, Gap statistics, and silhouette methods to find the optimal number of clusters.
#### 🍷K-Means Clustering: Perform k-means clustering using the optimal number of clusters and evaluate the results.
#### 🍷PCA-Based Clustering: Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality, find optimal clusters, and evaluate using internal metrics.
