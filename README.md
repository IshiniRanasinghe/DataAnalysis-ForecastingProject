# DataAnalysis-ForecastingProject
wine quality analysis and exchange rate forecasting using data analytics and machine learning techniques.
This project involves two main tasks: clustering white wine varieties and forecasting exchange rates using a neural network.
## Wine Clustering
#### Steps:
#### 🍷Pre-processing: Scale data and remove outliers.
#### 🍷Determine Clusters: Use NBclust, Elbow, Gap statistics, and silhouette methods to find the optimal number of clusters.
#### 🍷K-Means Clustering: Perform k-means clustering using the optimal number of clusters and evaluate the results.
#### 🍷PCA-Based Clustering: Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality, find optimal clusters, and evaluate using internal metrics.
## Exchange Rate Forecasting
#### Steps:
#### 📌Input Variable Discussion: Discuss methods for defining input vectors for exchange rate forecasting.
#### 📌AR Approach: Use time-delayed values of exchange rates as input variables.
#### 📌Normalization: Normalize the input/output matrices.
#### 📌MLP Training/Testing: Train different MLP models and evaluate their performance using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE.
#### 📌Comparison: Compare different MLP models and discuss their efficiency.
#### 📌Best Model Analysis: Analyze and visualize the results of the best MLP model.
